# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React + TypeScript application for managing expert person profiles, featuring form interfaces and list views. The project was initially generated by Anima (a design-to-code tool) and uses modern React development practices.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### TypeScript
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript compiler to check types (tsc --noEmit)

### Important Notes
- No linting command is configured
- No test framework is installed
- No formatting tools (Prettier/ESLint) are configured

## Architecture Overview

### Component Structure
The application follows a screens-based architecture:

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── ui/          # Shadcn UI components (button, card, input, table, etc.)
├── screens/
│   ├── AltRightPanel/  # Main expert person form interface
│   │   ├── sections/   # Modular form sections
│   │   └── AltRightPanel.tsx
│   └── List/           # Alternative list view
└── lib/
    └── utils.ts        # Utility functions (cn for className merging)
```

### Key Technologies
- **React 18.2.0** with TypeScript
- **Vite** as the build tool and dev server
- **Shadcn UI** component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom design tokens
- **React Router DOM** (installed but not actively used)

### UI Component Library
The project uses Shadcn UI components located in `src/components/ui/`. These are:
- Copy-paste components (not an npm package)
- Built on Radix UI for accessibility
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Customizable through the `cn()` utility function

### Styling System
- Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- Custom design tokens defined in `tailwind.config.js`:
  - Font families: Inter, Roboto, and various system fonts
  - Custom colors, spacing, and border radius values
  - Extended animations and keyframes

### State Management
- No global state management library is used
- Components manage local state with React hooks

### Assets
- SVG icons stored in `public/` directory
- Images for profiles and UI elements

## Important Patterns

### Component Imports
When working with UI components, import from the local components directory:
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

### className Utility
Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes:
```typescript
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

className={cn("base-class", conditional && "conditional-class")}
```

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode is enabled
- Path alias `@` maps to `./src`
- Separate configs for app (`tsconfig.app.json`) and node environments

## Development Considerations

1. **No Testing Framework**: When adding new features, consider that there's no test infrastructure in place
2. **Generated Code**: Much of the initial code was auto-generated by Anima, so patterns may not always be consistent
3. **Form Handling**: The expert person form in AltRightPanel uses modular sections for different form parts
4. **Routing**: React Router is installed but not implemented - the app currently shows components directly
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode is enabled - ensure all new code is properly typed
